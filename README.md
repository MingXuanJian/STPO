# STPO 


STPO (Multi-strategy Enhanced Stork Optimization Algorithm) is an improved version of the Stork Optimization (PO) algorithm. Its core optimization strategies are as follows:

- **Sparrow Algorithm's Alert Mechanism**: When an individual is in an unfavorable state, it automatically increases alertness and deviates from the current extreme value area. This helps strengthen the ability to search locally while maintaining the ability to escape local optima, thereby improving the balance between exploration and exploitation.

- **Experience Exchange and Multi-source Learning**: This can enhance the diversity of the population and the speed of knowledge dissemination, making it easier to perform inter-basin searches in high-dimensional multimodal problems.

- **Worst-guided Differential Scaling Movement**: By adjusting the position of particles, this strategy promotes the diversity of the population, thereby improving the global search capability and accelerating convergence.
